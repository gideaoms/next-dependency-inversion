# Next Dependency Inversion

This project is an example of how to implement dependency inversion (DI) using [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) with server and client components.

There are two branchs: `main` and `initial`. The `initial` branch is the implementation without DI whereas `main` is the final implementation with DI.
